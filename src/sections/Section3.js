                <p>   The  Procuring  Entity  shall  use  the  criteria  and  methodologies  listed  in  this  Section  to  evaluate  Tenders.  By  applying  these  criteria  and  methodologies,  the  Procuring  Entity  shall  determine  the  successful  Tender  or  Tenders  which  has/have  been  determined  to:</p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>be  substantially  responsive  to  the  tender  documents;</li>
                    <li>offer  the  lowest  evaluated  cost  to  the  Procuring  Entity  for  all  items  of  Goods  to  be  procured  based  on  either  a  single  Contract  or  all  multiple  Contracts  combined,  as  the  case  may  be,  in  accordance  with  the  ITT  13.6  inviting  Tender  prices  and  discounts,  and  provisions  made  of  the  Tender  Document  for  evaluation  of  tenders  and  award  of  contract  (s);  and</li>

                <p>2.2 Evaluation of Tenders</p>
                <p>Preliminary examination for Determination of Responsiveness</p>
                <p>The  Procuring  Entity  will  start  by  examining  all  tenders  to  ensure  they  meet  in  all  respects  the  eligibility  criteria  and  other  mandatory  requirements  in  the  ITT,  and  that  the  tender  is  complete  in  all  aspects  in  meeting  the  requirements  provided  for  in  the  preliminary  evaluation  criteria  outlined  below.  The  Standard  Tender  Evaluation  Report  Document  for  Goods  and  Works  for  evaluating  Tenders  provides  very  clear  guide  on  how  to  deal  with  review  of  these  requirements.  Tenders  that  do  not  pass  the  Preliminary  Examination  will  be  considered  non-responsive  and  will  not  be  considered  further. </p>

                <p>2.2.1 Evaluation of Technical aspects of the Tender
                    The  Procuring  Entity  shall  evaluate  the  Technical  aspects  of  the  Tender  to  determine  compliance  with  the  Procuring  Entity's  requirements  under  Section  V  'Schedule  of  Requirement'  and  whether  the  Tenders  are  substantially  responsive  to  the  Technical  Speciﬁcations  and  other  Requirements.</p>
                <p>[The  Procuring  Entity  will  highlight  herein  any  particular  details,  characteristics,  functional  guarantees  or
                    other  requirements  under  the  speciﬁcations,  which  the  Tenderer  is  required  to  speciﬁcally  conﬁrm  or  provide  details  as  per  Section  V,  Supply  Requirements  or  other  parts  of  the  Tender  Document.  To  facilitate,  a  template  may  be  attached  or  clearly  described  all  information  and  list  of  documentation  to  be  submitted  by  Tenderers  to  enable  evaluation  of  Technical  parts  of  the  Tender]</p>
                <p>2.2.2 Evaluation  of  Commercial  Terms  and  Conditions  of  the  Tender  (ITT  33.1(a)):</p>
                <p>The  Procuring  Entity  shall  determine  whether  the  Tenders  are  substantially  responsive  to  the  Commercial  and  Contractual  Terms  and  Conditions  (e.g.  Performance securities, Payment and delivery schedules).</p>
                <p>[The  Procuring  Entity  will  highlight  herein  any  particular  requirements  under  the  Contract  which  the  Tenderer  is  required  to  speciﬁcally  conﬁrm  or  provide  information  to  enable  evaluation  of  Commercial  Terms  and  Conditions  of  the  Tender]
                    2.2.3 Evaluation Criteria (Other Factors) (ITT 33.6)</p>
                <p>The  Procuring  Entity's  evaluation  of  a  Tender  may  take  into  account,  in  addition  to  the  Tender  Price  quoted  in  accordance  with  ITT  13.8,  one  or  more  of  the  following  factors  as  speciﬁed  in  ITT  33.2(d)  and  in  TDS  ITT  33.6,  using  the  following  criteria  and  methodologies.</p>
                <li>   3. MARGIN OF PREFERENCE</li>
                <p>  3.1 If  the  TDS  so  speciﬁes,  the  Procuring  Entity  will  grant  a  margin  of  preference  of  15%  (ﬁfteen  percent)  to  Tenderers  offering  goods  manufactured,  mined,  extracted,  grown,  assembled  or  semi-processed  in  Kenya.  Goods  assembled  or  semi-processed  in  Kenya  shall  have  a  local  content  of  not  less  than  40%.</p>
                <p> 3.2 The  margin  of  preference  will  be  applied  in  accordance  with,  and  subject  to,  the  following  provisions:</p>
                <ol type="a" >
                    <li>  Tenderers  applying  for  such  preference  on  goods  offered  shall  provide,  as  part  of  the  data  for  qualiﬁcation,  such  information,  including  details  of  the  goods  produced  in  Kenya,  so  as  to  determine  whether,  according  to  the  classiﬁcation  established  by  the  Procuring  Entity,  a  particular  category  of  goods  or  group  of  goods  qualiﬁes  for  a  margin  of  preference.</li>
                    <li> After  Tenders  have  been  received  and  reviewed  by  the  Procuring  Entity,  goods  offered  in  the  responsive  Tenders  shall  be  assessed  to  ascertain  they  are  manufactured,  mined,  extracted,  grown,  assembled  or  semi-  processed  in  Kenya.  Responsive  tenders  shall  be  classiﬁed  into  the  following  groups:</li>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li> Group  A:  Tenders  offering  goods  manufactured  in  Kenya,  for  which  (a)  labour,  raw  materials,  and  components  from  within  Kenya  account  for  more  than  forty  (40)  percent  of  the  Ex-Works  price;  and
                            (b)  the  production  facility  in  which  they  will  be  manufactured  or  assembled  has  been
                            engaged  in  manufacturing  or  assembling  such  goods  at  least  since  the  date  of  Tender
                            Submission date;</li>
                        <li> Group  B:  All  other  Tenders  offering  Goods  manufactured  in  Kenya;</li>
                        <li>Group  C:  Tenders  offering  Goods  manufactured  outside  Kenya  that  have  been  already  imported  or  that  will  be  imported.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>To  facilitate  this  classiﬁcation  by  the  Procuring  Entity,  the  Tenderer  shall  complete  whichever  version  of  the  Price  Schedule  furnished  in  the  Tender  Documents  is  appropriate.  Incorrect  classiﬁcation  may  render  the  Tender  non-responsive  as  no  reclassiﬁcation  will  be  permitted  after  Tender  opening.  Tenderers  shall  provide  correct  information  especially  with  respect  to  duties,  taxes  etc.  paid  on  previously  imported  Goods  and  percentage  of  local  labour,  materials  and  components  for  Goods  manufactured  in  Kenya  as  any  false  information  which  cannot  be  supported  by  documentation  may  render  the  Tender  non-responsive  besides  other  sanctions  for  providing  falsiﬁed  information.</li>
                    <li>The  Procuring  Entity  will  ﬁrst  review  the  Tenders  to  conﬁrm  the  appropriateness  of  the  Tender  group  classiﬁcation  to  which  Tenderers  assigned  their  Tenders  in  preparing  their  Tender  Forms  and  Price  Schedules.</li>
                    <li>All  evaluated  Tenders  in  each  group  will  then  be  compared  to  determine  the  lowest  evaluated  Tender  of  each  group.  Such  lowest  evaluated  Tenders  shall  be  compared  with  each  other  and  if  as  a  result  of  this  comparison  a  Tender  from  Group  A  or  Group  B  is  the  lowest,  it  shall  be  selected  for  the  award.</li>
                    <li>If  as  a  result  of  the  preceding  comparison,  the  lowest  evaluated  Tender  is  a  Tender  from  Group  C,  all  Tenders  from  Group  C  shall  be  further  compared  with  the  lowest  evaluated  Tender  from  Group  A  after  adding  to  the  evaluated  price  of  goods  offered  in  each  Tender  from  Group  C,  for  the  purpose  of  this  further  comparison  only,  an  amount  equal  to  15%  (ﬁfteen  percent)  of  the  respective  CIP  Tender  price  for  goods  to  be  imported  and  already  imported  goods.  Both  prices  shall  include  unconditional  discounts  and  be  corrected  for  arithmetical  errors.  If  the  Tender  from  Group  A  is  the  lowest,  it  shall  be  selected  for  award.  If  not,  the  lowest  evaluated  Tender  from  Group  C  shall  be  selected  as  per  paragraph  (e)  above.”</li>
                </ol>
                <li> Post-Qualiﬁcation of Tenderers (ITT 37)
                    <p>  [Note  for  Procuring  Entity  to  be  deleted  before  issuing  the  tender  documents.
                        This  STD  for  Procurement  of  Goods  assumes  that  no  Prequaliﬁcation  has  taken  place  before  tendering.  However,  if  a  Prequaliﬁcation  process  is  undertaken,  the  Qualiﬁcation  Criteria  stipulated  in  this  Section  III,  Evaluation  and  Qualiﬁcation  Criteria  must  be  updated  to  ensure  that  the  Tenderer  and  any  Sub-  Suppliers  shall  meet  or  continue  to  meet  the  Criteria  used  at  the  time  of  Prequaliﬁcation.]</p>
                    <p>4.1 Post-Qualiﬁcation Criteria (ITT 37.1)
                        In  case  the  tender  was  not  subject  to  pre-qualiﬁcation,  the  tender  that  has  been  determined  to  be  the  lowest  evaluated  tenderer  shall  be  considered  for  contract  award,  subject  to  meeting  each  of  the  following  conditions  (post  qualiﬁcation  Criteria  applied  on  a  GO/NO  GO  basis).  The  Procuring  Entity  shall  carry  out  the  post-  qualiﬁcation  of  the  Tenderer  in  accordance  with  ITT  37,  using  only  the  requirements  speciﬁed  herein.  Requirements  not  included  in  the  text  below  shall  not  be  used  in  the  evaluation  of  the  Tenderer's  qualiﬁcations.  The  minimum  qualiﬁcation  requirements  for  multiple  contracts  will  be  the  sum  of  the  minimum  requirements  for  respective  individual  contracts,  unless  otherwise  speciﬁed.</p>
